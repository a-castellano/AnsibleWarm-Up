# AnsibleWarm-Up

Actual [repo](https://git.windmaker.net/a-castellano/AnsibleWarm-Up).

I have not been using Ansible for almost 3 years, time to warm-up.

I am currently following [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) book written by [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy).
